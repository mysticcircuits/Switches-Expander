# Switches-Expander

Files for the Switches Turing Machine Expander module by Mystic Circuits.

This module comes with an open source licence, CC-BY-SA 3.0. Go ahead and read the licence page for more details. This means that there are no commercial restrictions on this module. Please be reasonable in your interpretation of this rule. I fully support people building their own circuit boards and even trading amongst their friends for them. However organizing group buys for these PCBs or selling the PCBs on your own will compete directly with my own products, since I sell PCBs on my website and also provide the build documentation and support. In short - don't be a shmuck about it or else I will stop open sourcing my designs.

Also note that this module is made to function with my "Universal Front Plate" PCB which is hosted in another branch. It can make the schematic a bit tricky to read sometimes but I did my best to annotate things. There might be some inconsistencies between the pin naming convention for this schematic and the one on the "UFP" schematic because this was among the first circuits that I build to work with the UFP and they both went through several revisions together.

For a description of the licence in simple terms please visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

Also my build documentation uses a lot of high resolution pictures so the final size is about 45 MB. Check this link to see the build documentation as well as the BOM: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1jw1Qp2qZVJV1ByMFp5SVN3X0U/view?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-EDNIhMWUD5uWKayrew_lzA
